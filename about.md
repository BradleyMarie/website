<p>Hi, I'm Brad! I'm a software engineer living in Los Angeles and working on
YouTube. I've been in the industry since I graduated from Northwestern University
in 2012. I started at Google in June of 2017 and transfered to the YouTube team in
February of 2020. Before Google, I lived for 5 years in the rainy Pacific Northwest
where I worked at both Amazon and Microsoft.</p>

<p>I love software problems of all kinds and I'm at home working anywhere in the
stack. At Amazon and Google, my time has primarily been spent working with 
distributed systems. In the Amazon world, that meant web services which interact
via HTTP and store their data in NoSQL backends. At Google, that means Stubby
and magical distributed storage backends like Spanner.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, my time at Microsoft was spent
investigating and solving performance issues throughout the Windows codebase. To
give a few examples of what that meant, code I wrote ships today in the Xbox
hypervisor, the NT kernel, the HoloLens video capture pipeline, and the Windows
Performance Analyzer.</p>

<p>While I was an undergraduate at Northwestern, I contributed to the 
<a href="http://www.v3vee.org/palacios/">Palacios</a> hypervisor and the super neat
<a href="http://omnipedia.northwestern.edu/">Omnipedia</a> client for 
Wikipedia. I also wrote my own <a href="https://github.com/BradleyMarie/L5c">compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending my free time skiing, hiking, traveling,
watching movies, and working on my 
<a href="https://github.com/BradleyMarie/Iris">ray tracer</a>.</p>
